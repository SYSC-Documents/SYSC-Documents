### Public Storage area for files to support SystemC applications



Files should be stored in a folder that corresponds to the form the files are used in. For example if the files are supporting the Service Request Form in LAS then the folder the files are in should be



**LCS-CareLeaversAssessment**



Please avoid using spaces in both filename and directory names, also use camel case to avoid any ambiguity

under the form name folder should come the split by type using the format:



* Pics
* Docs
* Video
* Misc
  etc



Files should follow a similar format with a brief description in the name as to what it relates to calling files 1.jpg etc should be avoided, as an example:



**PayTypesUniversalU18.png**



Is a picture describing what payment types are used in the universal category for under 18s



An explanatory README.md file can be included in the form level directory if further explanation is needed as to functionality
As part of the commit, please put the call reference the files have been uploaded as a result of, for example:

**SR-456781 Pictures amended due to statutory change**
